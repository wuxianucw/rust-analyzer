Before submitting, please make sure that you're not running into one of these known issues:

 1. on-the-fly diagnostics are mostly unimplemented (`cargo check` diagnostics will be shown when saving a file): #3107
 2. attribute proc macros are supported but not enabled by default: #6029
 3. proc macros crash the language server on nightly and beta compiler versions: #8925

Otherwise please try to provide information which will help us to fix the issue faster. Minimal reproducible examples with few dependencies are especially lovely <3.
